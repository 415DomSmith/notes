# RSpec Testing

* <h3> TDD - Test Driven Development</h3>

# Student Learning Objectives:

* <h3> By the end of this lesson you should be able to:</h3>

	* <h3> 1) Set up an rspec testing environment for a ruby project</h3>

	* <h3> 2) Write basic describe/it blocks to test an existing Class</h3>
	
	* <h3> 3) Go through Red/Green/Refactor routine to create a Class with tests</h3>
	
## Why do we write tests

* <h3> Helps you organize your thoughts to understand the problem or feature you are trying to code. </h3>

* <h3> Go back to edit your program after a period of time, you can review the tests to see how the program is supposed to work. </h3>


* <h3> You can refactor you code with some degree of assuance that your program still works. </h3>

* <h3> For every new edit you want to release, you don't want to have to test all the buttons and links in you web site</h3>

* <h3> On a project team, you write code that could break someone else's code.</h3>
	
* <h3> On a project team, someone writes code that could break your code.</h3>
	

## Test Driven Development Flow:

### Mantra: Red, Green, Refactor

*  <h3> "Red" => write test, run test, test fails</h3>
*  <h3>"Green" => write just enough code to make it pass</h3>
*  <h3> "Refactor" => look for ways to improve your code</h3>



# 1) Setup rspec test environment:

## Installation
	$ gem install rspec
	$ rspec --v
	$ rspec --help

### Go to your working folder for todays lesson
	$ rspec --init
		create spec/spec_helper.rb
		create .rspec
 

* <h3> rspec --init created:</h3>
	* <h3> a spec folder with the spec_helper.rb file in it</h3>
	* <h3> a .rspec file that is for your configuration </h3>

### Edit .rspec ( use: "ls -la" to see the hidden files)

#### Open .rspec and add the lines:
	--color
	--format documentation

	
### Review spec_helper.rb

* <h3> spec_helper.rb makes the RSpec tests are run in a random order.</h3>
* <h3>Beware of dependencies, tests should be indepentent.</h3>


		$ cd spec
		$ cat spec_helper.rb




* <h3>spec_helper.rb:</h3>

		# This file was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
		# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
		# Require this file using `require "spec_helper"` to ensure that it is only
		# loaded once.
		#
		# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration
		RSpec.configure do |config|
			config.treat_symbols_as_metadata_keys_with_true_values = true
			config.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true
			config.filter_run :focus

			# Run specs in random order to surface order dependencies. If you find an
			# order dependency and want to debug it, you can fix the order by providing
			# the seed, which is printed after each run.
			#     --seed 1234
			config.order = 'random'
		end


#2) Write basic describe/it blocks to test an existing Class 

## RSpec Testing Syntax Structure:
*  <h3> describe blocks</h3>
*  <h3> context block (optional)</h3> 
*  <h3> it blocks</h3>


#### Sample code

	describe Square do
	  it "has a side attribute" do
	    test code
	  end

	  it "has an area method" do
	    test code
	  end
	end

## Special blocks: Before & After
* <h3> Due to the random order of tests, you can't rely on the conditions of one test to setting up the other. </h3>
* <h3> Eliminate the "order dependencies".</h3>
* <h3> Before block runs before each test</h3>

		before(:each) do  
    		@my_square = Square.new(5)
    	end
    	
    	after(:each) do  
    		@my_square = nil
    	end
 
* <h3> After block runs after each test</h3>



## square.rb

	class Square
		attr_accessor :side
		
		def initialize(side)
    		@side = side
    	end
    	
    	def area
    		@side ** 2
    	end
    	
    	def perimeter
    		@side * 4
    	end
    	
    	def to_s
    		"I am a square. My sides are of length: #{@side}. My area is: #{self.area}, and my perimeter is: #{self.perimeter}"
    	end
    end


## square_spec.rb

	require './square'
	require 'spec_helper'
	
	describe Square do  
	
		before(:each) do  
    		@my_square = Square.new(5)
    	end
    
    	it "should have a side" do
    	    my_square = Square.new(5)
    		@my_square.side.should eq(5)
    	end

    end
    
# 3) Go through Red/Green/Refactor routine to create a Class with tests

## Employee Code Along
### Let's design an Employee class:

* <h3> What attributes and behaviors should our Employee object have?</h3>

### Create two files: employee.rb and employee_spec.rb

#### employee_spec.rb:

	require './employee'
	require 'spec_helper'

	describe Employee do
      
      before(:each) do
	    @employee = Employee.new("YourName")
      end

	  it "has a name " do
	  	@employee.name.should eq("YourName")
	  end
	  
	  it "can change the name" do
	    @employee.name = "NewName"
	    @employee.name.should eq("YourName")
	  end
	  
	end

#### employee.rb

	class Employee
	  attr_accessor :name

	  def initialize(name)
		@name = name
	  end

	end
	



list of commands like eq

should vs. expect

combine into a folder for a repo
