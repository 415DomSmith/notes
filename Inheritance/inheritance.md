#Inheritance

##Objectives:
1. Describe what is inheritance is and identify the benefits & disadvantages of its use. Create a 2 classes in which one class inherits from another class.
1. Create a class that can override methods from it's parent class.
1. Illustrate the different ways you can load code: load, require, require_relative

##Quick Quiz Review:
1. What is a method? What is an instance method?
1. What is a class? What is class method?

##Goal #1 - Inheritance:

- Inheritance is used to indicate that one class will get most or all of its features from a parent class. 
    
*When is inheritance useful?
        a. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

REPLACE        b. Rails uses it heavily.

        c. Example: Suppose you're building an application  helps you ship goods. Many forms of shipping are available, but all forms share some basic functionality (weight calculation, perhaps). We donâ€™t want to duplicate the code that implements this functionality across the implementation of each shipping type. 

##Demo
```
class Animal
  def speak
    puts "I am an animal"
  end
end
```

```
class Person < Animal
    def initialize(age, gender, name)
        @age = age
        @gender = gender
        @name = name
    end
end
```

- Single Inheritance
    - In Ruby, a class can only inherit from a single other class. It *cannot* inherit from multiple classes.

    - Benefits and disadvantages to single & multiple inheritance
    - In Ruby, initialize is an ordinary method and inherited just like another method.

##Code-Along
```
class Box

  def initialize(w, h)
    @width = w 
    @height = h
  end

  def get_area
    @width * @height
  end

end

class BigBox < Box

  def print_area
    @area = @width * @height
  end

end

#create an object
box = BigBox.new(10, 20)

#print the area
puts box.print_area()
```

##Exercise #1:
Create a Mammal class, Cat class, and Dog class. Have Cat and Dog inherit from Mammal. Include some attributes for each class and a method for mammal.

##Goal 2 - Overriding & Super:

Demo

```
class Dog  
  def initialize(breed)  
    @breed = breed  
  end  
  
  def to_s  
    "(#@breed, #@name)"  
  end  
end  
  
class Lab < Dog  
  def initialize(breed, name)  
    super(breed)  
    #super 
        #calls the method of the parent class
        #& passes all the arguments into the parent class
    @name = name  
  end  
end  
  
puts Lab.new("Labrador", "Ben").to_s 
# .to_s is called implicitly with any puts or print or p method call  
```

- When you invoke *super* with arguments, Ruby sends a message to the parent of the current object, asking it to invoke a method of the same name as the method invoking super. super sends exactly those arguments.

##Exercise #2:
Create a Bird class & a Penguin class. Give the Bird class an initialize, preen, and fly methods. Give the Penguin class a new fly method (since it cannot fly).


##Goal #3 - load, require, require_relative
    - When your projects start to grow & you start using multiple files, you'll need Ruby's require and load methods.

```
class Calendar
  def initialize(month, year)
    @month = month
    @year  = year
  end

  # A simple wrapper around the *nix cal command.
  def to_s
    IO.popen(["cal", @month.to_s, @year.to_s]) { |io| io.read }
  end
end

puts Calendar.new(8, 2011)
```

##load
- This will reload the ruby file every time it's called.
- Load is typically used for checking for small changes and debugging - does not keep track of whether a file or library has been loaded

1. In Pry, try this:
    ``` pry(main)> load 'calendar.rb'```
1. Now add to the initialize: 
    ```@day = day```


##require
- This will load a ruby file ONCE and only once. All subsequent require statements will not reload the file.
- Doesn't need the .rb file extension, but won't hurt if it's there.


##require_relative
