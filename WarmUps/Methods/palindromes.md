# Warm Up
## Palindromes


A **palindrome** is a word that spells out the same word when the letters are reversed.

Notable Examples:
	
	dad
	mom
	pop
	eye
	civic
	kayak
	level
	madam
	radar
	racecar
	

Directions: write a function called `is_palindrome` that returns `true` if a word is a palindrome or `false` if it isn't.
