## Round Table

You're sitting at a round table with a group of friends staring at the last piece of cake. Luckily, you've all decided on a rule for who gets the cake in these situations. Beginning with one friend at the table, you begin eliminating every second cake seeker from the table. The last person at the table gets the cake. Write an algorithm for who gets the cake.
