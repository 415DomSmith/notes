# Getting Started
## Node Install

Since we have `brew` installed we can just install node with it

```
$ brew install node
```
or if you're feeling more browser friendly try the following [node link](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Once finished, you should be able to interact with the `node` repl by saying

```
$ node 
``` 

or you can run a javascript file like the one below

`hello.js`

```
console.log("hello world!")
```

by using the pattern `node <filename>` in javascript.

```
$ node hello.js
```
