## Designating Roles

We suggest __3 roles__ that should be taken on:

1. __Operations__ - Responsible for the pull requests getting merged.  Makes sure that all pull requests are code reviewed by someone.  Also, should be in charge of pushing to heroku.
2. __Project Management__ - Runs a daily (*or twice daily*) meeting to sync up on what's done and what is yet to be done.  Needs to make sure that tasks are worked on in priority order to get your **MVP** done.
3. __Product Management__ - Responsible for the overall look and feel of the project.  In charge of making sure small details about the user experience of the project are consistent and high quality.

## Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a tool we want you to use to manage priorities and action items for the group. It essential to list the following on Trello as well as in your project `ReadME`.

* **Brief Project Description**
* **MVP** (A minimal *feature* list)
* **Milestones** (discernible, critical steps required to complete a *feature*)
	* **Wireframe** links or snapshots should be included. 
* **Potential Resources/API Info**
* **Wishlist Items** (*for things just outside your MVP*)

__Identify the following:__

* Questionable - A question on some topic that needs some researching (an unknown or not well understood task)
* Blocker - A bug or issue that is breaking the app or stopping progress.  Development is significantly limited because of the issue.

## Teamwork

Identify a few areas of interest or improvement for each person in the team, and have them own the responsibility of engaging in pair programming for this assignment. Being able to *articulate* learned skills or developing skills with your group members is one of the goals of this project.

* Pair programming
	* While pair programming designate a __driver__ (person with the keyboard) and a __navigator__ (person not typing).

## Good Software Practices

* Comment your code
* Testing
* Submitting pull requests (only after the tests pass)
* Code reviews
* Pushing to heroku frequently
