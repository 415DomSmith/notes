## Designating Roles

We suggest __3 roles__ that should be taken on:

1. __Operations__ - Responsible for the pull requests getting merged.  Makes sure that all pull requests are code reviewed by someone.  Also, should be in charge of pushing to heroku.
2. __Project Management__ - Runs a dialy (or twice daily) meeting to sync up on what's done and what is yet to be done.  Needs to make sure that tasks are worked on in priority order to get your mvp done.
3. __Product Management__ - Responsible for the overall look and feel of the project.  In charge of making sure small details about the user experience of the project are consistent and high quality.

## Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a good tool you can use to manage the tasks for your project.

__Identify the following:__

* Questionable - A question on some topic that needs some researching (an unknown or not well understood task)
* Blocker - A bug or issue that is breaking the app or stopping progress.  Development is significantly limited because of the issue.

## Teamwork

* Pair programming
	* While pair programming designate a __driver__ (person with the keyboard) and a __navigator__ (person not typing).

## Good Software Practices

* Comment your code
* Testing
* Submitting pull requests (only after the tests pass)
* Code reviews
* Pushing to heroku frequently
